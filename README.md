## Unleashing the Power of Sentiment Analysis :chart_with_upwards_trend: :mag_right:

Welcome to Sentixtract, an ambitious project that aims to make data mining and sentiment analysis a breeze using state-of-the-art models and APIs. Embrace the comprehensive dashboard that provides valuable insights into the provided services. Our current service offerings include:

1. Extract Tweets
2. Sentiment Analysis Based on COVID Model
3. Google Perspective API Use Case
4. Extract Tweets with Sentiment Scores

## Project Summary :clipboard:

In the realm of machine learning, sentiment analysis or opinion mining takes the center stage. Sentixtract showcases a foundational method of classifying tweets into positive or negative categories, employing LSTM as a baseline model. Delving deeper, the project explores the remarkable connections between language models and LSTM, which culminates in improved results. By fine-tuning parameters, incorporating diverse features, and tapping into external APIs like the Google Perspective API, the classifier's performance can be elevated to new heights.
